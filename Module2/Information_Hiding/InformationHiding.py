# Information hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of the classes and simply providing interface 
# Through which outside world can communicate without knowing what is happening behind the scences within a class

The purpose of information hiding is to implement classes in such a way that instances/objects should not be used for any 
unauthorized access/change in classes. Also, the two classes cannot know about algorithms in other classes but can still communicate.

Information Hiding has two components:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
