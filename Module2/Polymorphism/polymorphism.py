# PolyMorphism is a combination of two greek words: Poly means Many and Morph means Many. 
'''
In short polymorphism means that a thing which have many shapes and forms. 

'''
'''
Consider an Example of Shape:
Square, Rectangle, Circle, Polygon and a Diamond are examples of shape. 
But Keep in mind that All of these shapes have different properties. This is Polymorphism. 
'''
'''
Now consider if we have to code this example and we also have to calculate the area of each specific shape. 
We have to mention a specific method for each subclass of shape. But Polymorphism allows us to use a single method getArea()
in parent class instead of writing specific methods for each subclass.
