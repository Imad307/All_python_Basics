# Python boasts a huge library of built-in functions.
# String Methods 
# Functions that are properties of a particular entity are known as methods. These methods can be accessed using the '.'operator. 
# The string data type has several methods associated with it. Letâ€™s look at some of them.

# For search we use .find() in a given string, we can also use inexes for specific substrings
#  we can also replace a word or a substring with the help of .replace()
# Uppercase or lowercase can also be achieved by .upper() or .lower() 
# .join(list) can be used to join multiple strings in a list as well.
'''llist = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print('>>'.join(llist)) # joining strings with >>
print('<<'.join(llist)) # joining strings with <<
print(', '.join(llist)) # joining strings with comma and space'''
# Formatting: format() can be used for formating of differnt parametrs in a string. 
'''string1 = "Learn Python {version} at {cname}".format(version = 3, cname = "Educative")
string2 = "Learn Python {0} at {1}".format(3, "Educative")
string3 = "Learn Python {} at {}".format(3, "Educative")

print(string1)
print(string2)
print(string3)'''
