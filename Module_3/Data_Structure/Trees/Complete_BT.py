'''
A type of binary tree in which all nodes at all level are fully filled except for the last one and we fill the last level from left to right.
Tot. no. of nodes in Complete binary tree: 2^h <= nodes <=  (2^(h+1))-1
Tot. no of non-leaf nodes: 2^(h-1) <non-leaf nodes <=  (2^h)-1
Tot. No. of leaf nodes: 2^(h-1)<leaf nodes<= 2^h
Insertion in Complete Binary tree: 
Nodes are inserted aree level by level.
Fill in the far left nodes as possible.
